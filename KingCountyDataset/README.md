#Execute the code sequentially.
#the credentials for executing the postgresql are stored in the .env file which stores the required credentials to run the script.

#The workflow includes

*Storing the raw data into mongodb database programatically and querying.
*Performing the data analysis.
    Exploring data characteristics- Exploring and understanding each column
    Data manipulation- performing feature engineering for better understanding of the data
    Data preprocessing- processing the data in most relavent way
    Exploratory data analysis- performing visualizations to get more insights into the data
    Machine learning algorithms- using decision tree and XGBoost algorithms to predict the house prices
*Storing the transformed data to postgresql.
